# Student Exemption Application

**Graduation project in the second semester(2019). Frontend was built with Boostrap, backend was built with Node.JS(Express.JS, Mongoose) and MongoDB was used for the database. This is my first attempt to build a fully-functional web application**

The application is used to apply for course exemption. The application is divided into two parts:

- **Student Page**: The student can enter a course on this page and select the equivalent course. The student can also print the matching course list.
- **Admin Page**: The admin can select a student and view the matching course list, mark the matched course request as approved or rejected.
